## Getting Started with Salesforce Indicators

Thank you for choosing Salesforce Indicators to enhance your Lightning Pages! This documentation will help you get started using the app.

### What is Salesforce Indicators

### Why Salesforce Indicators

* **Information at a Glance**: Salesforce Indicators offers organizations the ability to access crucial information at a glance. With customizable indicators, teams can quickly discern key data points, enabling swift and informed decision-making.
 
* **Enhanced Decision-Making**: By streamlining data visualization, Salesforce Indicators facilitates enhanced decision-making processes within organizations. Teams can easily identify trends, patterns, and insights, leading to more strategic and effective actions.
 
* **Consistent Approach**: The versatility of Salesforce Indicators allows for a consistent approach to data visualization across various objects, such as accounts, contacts, and opportunities. This uniform setup ensures that users become familiar with where key information will be surfaced, promoting efficiency and coherence throughout the organization.

#### Object Structure of Salesforce Indicators

*  **Indicator Item**: The individual icon or text display, relating to your Salesforce field, which you want to display visually. For instance, if you want a quick visual indication that a particular contact has lapsed in engagement and you have criteria that indicates that, the Indicator itself can be used to represent that criteria.
* **Indicator Bundle Item**: A container object that takes the Indicator Item you have created and represents it for the Bundle. The Indicator cannot be added to the Bundle without this bridge object (Similar to Affiliations for those using NPSP and EDA).
* **Indicator Bundle**: Collection of Indicator Bundle Items for display on the Lightning Record Page. Collects the Indicator Items created for an object and added via Indicator Bundle Item into one component for the actual visual representation.

#### What to Install

* **Getting to Know Salesforce Indicators**: Install in a Trailhead Org or Scratch Org to learn how to use Salesforce Indicators. Include the Sample Indicators and Sample Layouts.
* **Ready for your Production Org**: We reccomend Installing in sandbox and install the main Indicators latest release.
