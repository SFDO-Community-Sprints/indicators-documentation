## 1. Design your Salesforce Indicators model

* Before creating your first **Indicator Bundle** or **Indicator Item** consider the data that will drive your indicators. 
* Below is a visual of the data model for each Component.

* Consider your field design. Design field to be multi-use where ever possible.
>>this needs to be built out further describing the challenge of using boolean fields with other data, giving the example of memberships (is active) and months to end date
* Are you using [DLRS?](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Salesforce-Indicators/wiki/Additional-Complementary-Apps-and-Components-to-Enhance-Your-Org#declarative-lookup-rollup-summary-salesforce-open-source-commons) Consider whether this app could help you surface the indicators you need.
