# What is Salesforce Indicators?

Built by the community for the community, Salesforce Indicators helps users improve productivity and efficiency by ensuring that critical information does not go unnoticed, buried between other less important data on the Salesforce record.

Installed as an app in your Salesforce org, the Indicators Lightning Web Component (LWC) delivers out-of-the-box easy to use features to highlight important data with icons and colors, making it easy to focus on what matters most. Make key details pop and highlight insights at a glance on your Salesforce records â€“ without cluttering the page or interfering with data entry.
