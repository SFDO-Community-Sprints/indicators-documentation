## Brag Book

We have to celebrate our achievements. These are just some that We've heard of so far. 

* A previous client rang Jodie out of the blue and said "hey you know that indicator panel we had in our org at X company, can I have it in my new company's org".
* A random phone call on Jodie's business number and an older gentleman says "is that The Detail Department"? I say "yes?" he says "I just saw your YouTube video and I want you to install Salesforce Indicators in my Salesforce org". 
* An Admin after using Salesforce Indicators for the first time "Oh I just get it now!".
* A private message on a Zoom Webinar about a completely unrelated topic "I just installed your Salesforce Indicators component in my Sandbox and I will be using it in my demo this week. It is really neat and fills a much needed void in the product". How cool! 
* Jodie's client explaining a new feature to a user who had just come back from holidays "Oh and there are these icons on the right hand that display when the data gets to the external system and then it another icon appears when the external system updates Salesforce to say it's done, so you just have to look at the icons". It is really cool when the users take ownership of the Indicators and they can immediately see how the icons displaying and changing based on the record changing, can help. 
* Our first review [Blog Post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/salesforce-users-love-new-indicators-lightning-web-component-bragau)!
* Don't just take our word for it, check out what [Bart](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7126569525889638400?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7126569525889638400%29) and [Ritesh](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7117320514183856128?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7117320514183856128%29) have to say.
* Emma Keeling wrote a fabulous blog post about how the [National Youth Orchestra of Great Britian uses Salesforce Indicators](https://hazledenesolutions.co.uk/2024/02/10/data-illumination-seeing-the-essential-with-salesforce-indicators/). 
* An Admin first heard about Salesforce Indicators from her user's returning from a World Tour event and they asked their Admin to install Salesforce Indicators for them. The Admin's response after installing Salesforce Indicators - "Convert here!"
* Daryl Moon from Certify CRM has included Salesforce Indicators in his [User Experience Design Course](https://certifycrm.com/courses/user-experience-design/) on Certify CRM. This course is really quite good, and extra special with the addition of Salesforce Indicators! 

And many other exclamations of joy from Sprint participants after they set up their first Indicator.
