## Project Team & Accomplishments
* Very robust and excellent discussion around videos, video production, and getting our message across.
* Talked Marc Baizman through Installing and getting started with Indicators which was great as he had not experience of it previously and we had a willing participant to experiment with. Marc then gave us some excellent suggestions to help with setup.
* Development team of Tim, Bobby and David did development
* Maria was our consistency champion and audited our full documentation site and fixed the missing links and inconsistent headings
* Teddy did some amazing content for a plan for videos we want to produce
* Shayna did some great content to help us over the setup and understanding “chasm”
* Emma did an amazing blog post, including getting a quote from her client about how Salesforce Indicators helped their org.
* Jodie had many epiphanies as per usual in a Sprint! Informational, Exceptions (Soft Alert), Next Actions, Quantitative, Qualitative (Ambient Alerts)
