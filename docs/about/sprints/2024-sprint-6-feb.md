## Project Team & Accomplishments

* Added more documentation
* Created YouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/@SalesforceIndicators
    * I failed at creating the banner for the YouTube site so I asked Tim to do that and he came up with an amazing banner in super quick time. 
    * This will be for both marketing our app and for storage for our team to build our marketing videos. 
* Created Salesforce Persistent Org to add our Demos
    * Thanks Cori for creating, and thanks Anand for suggesting
    * I have a heap of scratch orgs with demos in various states so it will be great to have them in the one place.
    * As Cori said, it is also a great tool to have to do regression testing for each release. 
* To publish on the AppExchange, some members of the team spent time starting the process to include demo videos to showcase the features of Salesforce Indicators.
* Identified and documented use Cases for Indicators for senior management.
* Created a how to guide for how to use Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries (DLRS) for Indicators to make it easier to surface helpful data on a record page.
Discussion and use case identification for using Salesforce Indicators with Campaigns and Campaign member documented in a [Powerpoint presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mGN2rUg1hWFVUoZqTmKGoPwH57qDlmzQl5u0fPmtfdI/edit#slide=id.g2be5ca226cd_4_0)
