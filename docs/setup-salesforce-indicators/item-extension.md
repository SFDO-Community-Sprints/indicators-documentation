## Indicator Item Extension

An Indicator Item Extension allows more icons to be configured for one field that displays when the field has different values. For example, <i>Industry</i> = "Accounting" or <i>Industry</i>= "Communications".

## Definition

Extensions are used to define any required variations to an Indicator Item. This can include variations to the icon appearance and changes to the selection criteria. 

## A Simple Usage example

An item for a Donor Status with a criteria of "contains" might have the following extensions:
* "Donor Status under $10k"
  * a pale green icon for total donations $0 to $9,999
* "Donor Status $10k - $50k"
  * a dark green icon for total donations $10,000 to $49,999
* "Donor Status $50k - $100k"
  * a pale yellow icon for total donations $50,000 to $99,999
* "Donor Status over $100k"
  * a dark yellow icon for total donations $100,000 or greater

## Add a new Indicator Item Extension
* Go to the *Indicators Setup* Tab
* Open the *Indicators Setup Menu*
* Use the *New* button to add a new **Indicator Item Extension**

## Edit an existing Indicator Item

* Go to the *Indicator Settings* Tab
  * Choose the Indicator Bundle that the Indicator Item is on (or the Item will be in *Unbundled Items* if the Item is not on a Bundle yet). 
  * Click the *Edit* button next to the Extension to edit.

OR, alternatively:

* Edit the Settings in CMDT:
  * Navigate to Salesforce *Setup* > *Custom Metadata Types*
  * Scroll to *Indicator Item Extensions*, and click *Manage Records*
  * Click *Edit* next to the Extension you want to edit

>New Field - Text Operator
>
>Now you can set up an Extension to display based on the following text logic:
>- **Contains**: (Will default to Contains if the field is empty). Eg *Title* Contains `CEO` 
>- **Does Not Equal**: Eg *Title* Does Not Equal `System Administrator`
>- **Equals**: Eg *Title* Equals `President`
>- **Starts With**: Eg *Title* Starts with `Vice President`

## Tips

**ðŸ’¡Setup Tips**
* See Recipes that use Extensions for more ideas
* If you create **Indicator Item Extensions** to cover all required variations, the **Indicator Item** does not need to have the Icon fields entered.
  * Eg values are Hot, Warm and Cold, and there is an Extension create for each value. There is no need to set up an Icon to show for *any value* or *blank value*.

{: .new-title}
>Display Multiple Icons with one Indicator
>
>This is an excellent new feature for use with Multi Select Picklists or [DLRS](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/DLRS-Documentation/) rollups using *Concatenate Distinct*. 
>
>For Example, you have a field on Contact named *Product Categories* that is a DLRS rollup of all the Product Families the Contact currently owns. Configure multiple Extensions with different Icons = eg *Product Categories* Contains `PHON`, *Product Categories* Contains `LPTP`, and *Product Categories* Contains `WTCH`. then if the Contact owns all three you will see 3 icons on the Contact Page. 
>
>Remember to check *Display Multiple* on the **Indicator Item** setup for this Indicator.
>
>We recommend including this Indicator in a Bundle on it's own, depending on how many Product Categories you have.

## Next Steps
* Create more **Indicator Item Extensions** as needed
* Add the Bundle to your [Lightning Page](../add-to-lightning-page) and check [The Key](../the-key)
