See [Install Salesforce Indicators](../install-salesforce-indicators/) if you have not already installed Salesforce Indicators.

## 1. Design your Salesforce Indicators model

* Before creating your first **Indicator Bundle** or **Indicator Item** consider the data that will drive your indicators. 
* Below is a visual of the data model for each Component.

![Salesforce Indicators Data Model](../images/setup/DataStructure.png){: width="590"}

* Consider your field design. Design field to be multi-use where ever possible.
  * ðŸ›  *this needs to be built out further describing the challenge of using boolean fields with other data, giving the example of memberships (is active) and months to end date*

* Are you using [Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries (DLRS)?](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Salesforce-Indicators/wiki/Additional-Complementary-Apps-and-Components-to-Enhance-Your-Org#declarative-lookup-rollup-summary-salesforce-open-source-commons) Consider whether DLRS could help you surface the data for the indicators you need.

## 2. Access the Salesforce Indicators setup Item
* Go to the *Indicators Setup* Tab

![Open Indicators Setup](../images/setup/OpenIndicatorsSetup.png){: width="590"}

## 4. Add to your Lightning Page

* Now you can add your Indicator Bundle to your [Lightning Page](../add-to-lightning-page).

## 5. Add your Indicator Item/s

* Use the *New* button to add a new [Indicator Item](indicator-item), and continue to add more Items.

## 6. Add your Indicator Bundle Item

## 7. Review The Key
