* Edit your Lightning Record Page (eg Account), and add the **Indicator Bundle** Component by dragging it to the desired location
* Choose the **Indicator Bundle** to show on the Page (eg Account Company Details). Ensure it is the correct Bundle to display for that Object
* Optionally choose to *Display Title* 
* Optionally choose to *Dieplay Description*
* Choose the *Indicator Size* - large or medium
* Choose the *Indicator Shape* - base or circle
* Optionally choose to show the *Refresh Button*. This is useful whilst you are setting up your Bundles.
