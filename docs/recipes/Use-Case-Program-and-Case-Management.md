* Have and indicator that visualized missed classes or sessions (Each org could set the value but you could have an indicator that displays, red, yellow or green based on a numeric value that is predefined.
* Have an indicator to note progress on a goal. (Like the SF path, but in an icon form)
* Have indicators to visually show how many programs, services, etc a person is currently in.  (For example you could create icons for each program, service and display them on the contact record)
* Display indicators to show the different goals a person is working on.  (You could create icons for predefined goals and display them on the contact record)
* Have an indicator to note is a person is currently active or inactive in services, programs, etc.  (Useful if an organization has people that come in and out of programs or services)
* Have an indicator that note is a person is at risk or need extra attention. (Similar to what Case Mangement currently has, but that is text based)
