# Description

This indicator will show a coloured icon when a membership is either due for renewal or is soon to be due for renewal. It will be required to create a custom field indicating whether the membership renewal threshold has been met based on the business rules. For example, whether the member should be contacted after their membership has ended, two weeks, or two months beforehand.
