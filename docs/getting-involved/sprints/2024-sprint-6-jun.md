## Jobs to be Done

Documentation ‘tidy up’ and sort of revisioning it - it’s not easy to ‘get going’

## Skills Needed

Looking for a niche set of folks/who have experience with indicators
No devs needed, have Tim already!


## Project Team & Accomplishments
### Report Back Day 1

# Who worked on your project team today? (First & Last name)
Emma Keeling
Abigail Julian
Melissa Hill Dees
Mustafa Baser
Carrie Mosley-O'Donnell
Anna Loughnan

# What have you accomplished today?
Agreed that Indicators documentation needed an overhaul with a improved user journey to get admins started. We have put together the concept of a new structure and have started documenting the 'missing pieces' within the structure - including a new 'overview' as a one pager marketing page.

# What are your next steps?
Continue working on the structure specifically and starting on the new pages...
Any other details to share?
Jodie has been working remotely in Australia on the AppExchange listing with Powerpoint, video with AI voiceover and music backing track created.
