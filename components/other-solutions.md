# Reviews

>To complete a review, use the [Component Review Template](component-review-template).

## Highlighting Tools
* [Picklist Image Coding Component](component-picklist-image-coding)
* [Highlighter: Dynamically highlight, rename, hide fields, conditional formatting](component-dynamic-highlighter)
* [Record Highlighter](component-record-highlighter)

## Field Visibility
* [Righteous Lightning Actions](righteous-lightning-actions) - such an amazing app, and I would really love a combination of this app and our app for our Exceptions component. I love the way you can have formatting and links in messages

## Declarative Lookup Rollup Summary (Salesforce Open Source Commons)
* [DLRS](https://install.salesforce.org/products#open-source-commons) - a sustainable open source community application that provides an admin-friendly declarative interface to generate and manage cross-object rollup summaries in your Salesforce org. 
* Install this to create cross-object rollup summaries that you can create indicators against.
